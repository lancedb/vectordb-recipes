This example shows how we can use a Neural Network to create movie embeddings. These embeddings can then be used to build a recommendation system that suggests relevant movies based on a given title.

### Note: The current implementation of the Neural Network is quite basic and serves primarily for the demonstration. While the movie recommendations generated are relatively simple and may be wrong, they can be significantly improved by using a more sophisticated and larger Neural Network within the same workflow.
