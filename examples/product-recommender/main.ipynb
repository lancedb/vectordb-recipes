    "# Product Recommender using Collaborative Filtering and LanceDB\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is a method to recommend movies by analyzing user preferences. It works by finding patterns in what users like. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User-based filtering**: If two users have similar tastes, movies liked by one can be suggested to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Item-based filtering**: If two movies are often liked together, recommending one suggests the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach uses past data, like movie ratings, to predict what someone might enjoy.\n",
