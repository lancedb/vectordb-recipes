## RAG Fusion - The New Star of Search Technology

### Overview
This repository contains code and implementation for RAG Fusion which is the enhanced version of RAG
and the future of RAG Technology for the improvement of RAG. This technology is still in process 
for getting the best out of it.

### Features
The main feature of this repo is RRF(Reciprocal Rank Fusion) Algorithm implemented which reranks the
documents based on the queries generated from original query given by user. It uses LanceDB as vector 
database to store and retrieve documents related to queries via OPENAI Embeddings. It can be used in 
any fields where we need to get the most information out of the box.
