In this context, existing methods typically propose candidate objects, usually as bounding boxes, and directly predict a binary mask within each such proposal. As a consequence, they cannot recover from errors in the object candidate generation process, such as too small or shifted boxes. In this paper, we introduce a novel object segment representation based on the distance transform of the object masks. We then design an object mask network (OMN) with a new residual-deconvolution architecture that infers such a representation and decodes it into the final binary object mask. This allows us to predict masks that go beyond the scope of the bounding boxes and are thus robust to inaccurate object candidates. We integrate our OMN into a Multitask Network Cascade framework, and learn the resulting shape-aware instance segmentation (SAIS) network in an end-to-end manner. Our experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and the CityScapes datasets demonstrate the benefits of our approach, which outperforms the state-of-the-art in both object proposal generation and instance segmentation.\",\n          \"Many applications in speech, robotics, finance, and biology deal with sequential data, where ordering matters and recurrent structures are common. However, this structure cannot be easily captured by standard kernel functions. To model such structure, we propose expressive closed-form kernel functions for Gaussian processes. The resulting model, GP-LSTM, fully encapsulates the inductive biases of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent networks, while retaining the non-parametric probabilistic advantages of Gaussian processes. We learn the properties of the proposed kernels by optimizing the Gaussian process marginal likelihood using a new provably convergent semi-stochastic gradient procedure, and exploit the structure of these kernels for scalable training and prediction. This approach provides a practical representation for Bayesian LSTMs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and thoroughly investigate a consequential autonomous driving application, where the predictive uncertainties provided by GP-LSTM are uniquely valuable.\",\n          \"In this paper a novel approach is proposed to predict intraday directional-movements of a currency-pair in the foreign exchange market based on the text of breaking financial news-headlines. The motivation behind this work is twofold: First, although market-prediction through text-mining is shown to be a promising area of work in the literature, the text-mining approaches utilized in it at this stage are not much beyond basic ones as it is still an emerging field. This work is an effort to put more emphasis on the text-mining methods and tackle some specific aspects thereof that are weak in previous works, namely: the problem of high dimensionality as well as the problem of ignoring sentiment and semantics in dealing with textual language. This research assumes that addressing these aspects of text-mining have an impact on the quality of the achieved results. The proposed system proves this assumption to be right. The second part of the motivation is to research a specific market, namely, the foreign exchange market, which seems not to have been researched in the previous works based on predictive text-mining. Therefore, results of this work also successfully demonstrate a predictive relationship between this specific market-type and the textual data of news. Besides the above two main components of the motivation, there are other specific aspects that make the setup of the proposed system and the conducted experiment unique, for example, the use of news article-headlines only and not news article-bodies, which enables usage of short pieces of text rather than long ones; or the use of general financial breaking news without any further filtration. In order to accomplish the above, this work produces a multi-layer algorithm that tackles each of the mentioned aspects of the text-mining problem at a designated layer. The first layer is termed the Semantic Abstraction Layer and addresses the problem of co-reference in text mining that is contributing to sparsity. Co-reference occurs when two or more words in a text corpus refer to the same concept. This work produces a custom approach by the name of Heuristic-Hypernyms Feature-Selection which creates a way to recognize words with the same parent-word to be regarded as one entity. As a result, prediction accuracy increases significantly at this layer which is attributed to appropriate noise-reduction from the feature-space. The second layer is termed Sentiment Integration Layer, which integrates sentiment analysis capability into the algorithm by proposing a sentiment weight by the name of SumScore that reflects investors\\u2019 sentiment. Additionally, this layer reduces the dimensions by eliminating those that are of zero value in terms of sentiment and thereby improves prediction accuracy. The third layer encompasses a dynamic model creation algorithm, termed Synchronous Targeted Feature Reduction (STFR). It is suitable for the challenge at hand whereby the mining of a stream of text is concerned. It updates the models with the most recent information available and, more importantly, it ensures that the dimensions are reduced to the absolute minimum. The algorithm and each of its layers are extensively evaluated using real market data and news content across multiple years and have proven to be solid and superior to any other comparable solution. The proposed techniques implemented in the system, result in significantly high directional-accuracies of up to 83.33%. On top of a well-rounded multifaceted algorithm, this work contributes a much needed research framework for this context with a test-bed of data that must make future research endeavors more convenient. The produced algorithm is scalable and its modular design allows improvement in each of its layers in future research. This paper provides ample details to reproduce the entire system and the conducted experiments. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. A.

However, these models remain unpopular due to computational and statistical inference issues, such as memory and time usage, as well as poor mixing of sampler. In this work we propose a novel framework which represents the HPYP model compactly using compressed suffix trees. Then, we develop an efficient approximate inference scheme in this framework that has a much lower memory footprint compared to full HPYP and is fast in the inference time. The experimental results illustrate that our model can be built on significantly larger datasets compared to previous HPYP models, while being several orders of magnitudes smaller, fast for training and inference, and outperforming the perplexity of the state-of-the-art Modified Kneser-Ney countbased LM smoothing by up to 15%.\",\n          \"Software organizations have typically de-emphasized the importance of software testing. In this paper, the results of a regional survey of software testing and software quality assurance techniques are described. Researchers conducted the study during the summer and fall of 2002 by surveying software organizations in the Province of Alberta. Results indicate that Alberta-based organizations tend to test less than their counterparts in the United States. The results also indicate that Alberta software organizations tend to train fewer personnel on testing-related topics. This practice has the potential for a two-fold impact: first, the ability to detect trends that lead to reduced quality and to identify the root causes of reductions in product quality may suffer from the lack of testing. This consequence is serious enough to warrant consideration, since overall quality may suffer from the reduced ability to detect and eliminate process or product defects. Second, the organization may have a more difficult time adopting methodologies such as extreme programming. This is significant because other industry studies have concluded that many software organizations have tried or will in the next few years try some form of agile method. Newer approaches to software development like extreme programming increase the extent to which teams rely on testing skills. Organizations should consider their testing skill level as a key indication of their readiness for adopting software development techniques such as test-driven development, extreme programming, agile modelling, or other agile methods.\",\n          \"We introduce a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) approach for real-time facial animation, which automatically estimates head rotation and facial action unit activations of a speaker from just her speech. Specifically, the time-varying contextual non-linear mapping between audio stream and visual facial movements is realized by training a LSTM neural network on a large audio-visual data corpus. In this work, we extract a set of acoustic features from input audio, including Mel-scaled spectrogram, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and chromagram that can effectively represent both contextual progression and emotional intensity of the speech. Output facial movements are characterized by 3D rotation and blending expression weights of a blendshape model, which can be used directly for animation. Thus, even though our model does not explicitly predict the affective states of the target speaker, her emotional manifestation is recreated via expression weights of the face model. Experiments on an evaluation dataset of different speakers across a wide range of affective states demonstrate promising results of our approach in real-time speech-driven facial animation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Compressed Nonparametric Language Modelling\",\n          \"A survey of software testing practices in alberta\",\n          \"Speech-driven 3 D Facial Animation with Implicit Emotional Awareness : A Deep Learning Approach\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 51,\n        \"min\": 112,\n        \"max\": 236,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          134,\n          236,\n          171\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3946595562275909,\n        \"min\": 6.037307262420654,\n        \"max\": 6.8111042976379395,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6.782823085784912,\n          6.037307262420654,\n          6.157275199890137\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Clickbait dissatisfies users because the article content does not match their expectation. Thus, clickbait detection has attracted more and more attention recently. Traditional clickbait-detection methods rely on heavy feature engineering and fail to distinguish clickbait from normal headlines precisely because of the limited information in headlines. A convolutional neural network is useful for clickbait detection, since it utilizes pretrained Word2Vec to understand the headlines semantically, and employs different kernels to find various characteristics of the headlines. However, different types of articles tend to use different ways to draw users\\u2019 attention, and a pretrained Word2Vec model cannot distinguish these different ways. To address this issue, we propose a clickbait convolutional neural network (CBCNN) to consider not only the overall characteristics but also specific characteristics from different article types. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional clickbait-detection algorithms and the TextCNN model in terms of precision, recall and accuracy.\",\n          \"a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t We present an automatic approach to the construction of BabelNet, a very large, wide-coverage multilingual semantic network. Key to our approach is the integration of lexicographic and encyclopedic knowledge from WordNet and Wikipedia. In addition, Machine Translation is applied to enrich the resource with lexical information for all languages. We first conduct in vitro experiments on new and existing gold-standard datasets to show the high quality and coverage of BabelNet. We then show that our lexical resource can be used successfully to perform both monolingual and cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation: thanks to its wide lexical coverage and novel semantic relations, we are able to achieve state-of the-art results on three different SemEval evaluation tasks.\",\n          \"This paper proposes quiz-style information presentation for interactive systems as a means to improve user understanding in educational tasks. Since the nature of quizzes can highly motivate users to stay voluntarily engaged in the interaction and keep their attention on receiving information, it is expected that information presented as quizzes can be better understood by users. To verify the effectiveness of the approach, we implemented read-out and quiz systems and performed comparison experiments using human subjects. In the task of memorizing biographical facts, the results showed that user understanding for the quiz system was significantly better than that for the read-out system, and that the subjects were more willing to use the quiz system despite the long duration of the quizzes. This indicates that quiz-style information presentation promotes engagement in the interaction with the system, leading to the improved user understanding.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Clickbait Convolutional Neural Network\",\n          \"BabelNet: The automatic construction, evaluation and application of a wide-coverage multilingual semantic network\",\n          \"Effects of quiz-style information presentation on user understanding\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 23,\n        \"min\": 112,\n        \"max\": 187,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          160,\n          133,\n          141\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"_distance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4484541118144989,\n          0.40246888995170593,\n          0.44178444147109985\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, these models remain unpopular due to computational and statistical inference issues, such as memory and time usage, as well as poor mixing of sampler. In this work we propose a novel framework which represents the HPYP model compactly using compressed suffix trees. Then, we develop an efficient approximate inference scheme in this framework that has a much lower memory footprint compared to full HPYP and is fast in the inference time. The experimental results illustrate that our model can be built on significantly larger datasets compared to previous HPYP models, while being several orders of magnitudes smaller, fast for training and inference, and outperforming the perplexity of the state-of-the-art Modified Kneser-Ney countbased LM smoothing by up to 15%.\",\n          \"We introduce a technique for augmenting neural text-to-speech (TTS) with lowdimensional trainable speaker embeddings to generate different voices from a single model. As a starting point, we show improvements over the two state-ofthe-art approaches for single-speaker neural TTS: Deep Voice 1 and Tacotron. We introduce Deep Voice 2, which is based on a similar pipeline with Deep Voice 1, but constructed with higher performance building blocks and demonstrates a significant audio quality improvement over Deep Voice 1. We improve Tacotron by introducing a post-processing neural vocoder, and demonstrate a significant audio quality improvement. We then demonstrate our technique for multi-speaker speech synthesis for both Deep Voice 2 and Tacotron on two multi-speaker TTS datasets. We show that a single neural TTS system can learn hundreds of unique voices from less than half an hour of data per speaker, while achieving high audio quality synthesis and preserving the speaker identities almost perfectly.\",\n          \"a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t We present an automatic approach to the construction of BabelNet, a very large, wide-coverage multilingual semantic network. Key to our approach is the integration of lexicographic and encyclopedic knowledge from WordNet and Wikipedia. In addition, Machine Translation is applied to enrich the resource with lexical information for all languages. We first conduct in vitro experiments on new and existing gold-standard datasets to show the high quality and coverage of BabelNet. We then show that our lexical resource can be used successfully to perform both monolingual and cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation: thanks to its wide lexical coverage and novel semantic relations, we are able to achieve state-of the-art results on three different SemEval evaluation tasks.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Compressed Nonparametric Language Modelling\",\n          \"Deep Voice 2 : Multi-Speaker Neural Text-to-Speech\",\n          \"BabelNet: The automatic construction, evaluation and application of a wide-coverage multilingual semantic network\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 23,\n        \"min\": 133,\n        \"max\": 187,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          134,\n          151,\n          133\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"_relevance_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6744159460067749,\n          0.1125519722700119,\n          0.25645574927330017\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Specifically, the time-varying contextual non-linear mapping between audio stream and visual facial movements is realized by training a LSTM neural network on a large audio-visual data corpus. In this work, we extract a set of acoustic features from input audio, including Mel-scaled spectrogram, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and chromagram that can effectively represent both contextual progression and emotional intensity of the speech. Output facial movements are characterized by 3D rotation and blending expression weights of a blendshape model, which can be used directly for animation. Thus, even though our model does not explicitly predict the affective states of the target speaker, her emotional manifestation is recreated via expression weights of the face model. Experiments on an evaluation dataset of different speakers across a wide range of affective states demonstrate promising results of our approach in real-time speech-driven facial animation.\",\n          \"In this paper a novel approach is proposed to predict intraday directional-movements of a currency-pair in the foreign exchange market based on the text of breaking financial news-headlines. The motivation behind this work is twofold: First, although market-prediction through text-mining is shown to be a promising area of work in the literature, the text-mining approaches utilized in it at this stage are not much beyond basic ones as it is still an emerging field. This work is an effort to put more emphasis on the text-mining methods and tackle some specific aspects thereof that are weak in previous works, namely: the problem of high dimensionality as well as the problem of ignoring sentiment and semantics in dealing with textual language. This research assumes that addressing these aspects of text-mining have an impact on the quality of the achieved results. The proposed system proves this assumption to be right. The second part of the motivation is to research a specific market, namely, the foreign exchange market, which seems not to have been researched in the previous works based on predictive text-mining. Therefore, results of this work also successfully demonstrate a predictive relationship between this specific market-type and the textual data of news. Besides the above two main components of the motivation, there are other specific aspects that make the setup of the proposed system and the conducted experiment unique, for example, the use of news article-headlines only and not news article-bodies, which enables usage of short pieces of text rather than long ones; or the use of general financial breaking news without any further filtration. In order to accomplish the above, this work produces a multi-layer algorithm that tackles each of the mentioned aspects of the text-mining problem at a designated layer. The first layer is termed the Semantic Abstraction Layer and addresses the problem of co-reference in text mining that is contributing to sparsity. Co-reference occurs when two or more words in a text corpus refer to the same concept. This work produces a custom approach by the name of Heuristic-Hypernyms Feature-Selection which creates a way to recognize words with the same parent-word to be regarded as one entity. As a result, prediction accuracy increases significantly at this layer which is attributed to appropriate noise-reduction from the feature-space. The second layer is termed Sentiment Integration Layer, which integrates sentiment analysis capability into the algorithm by proposing a sentiment weight by the name of SumScore that reflects investors\\u2019 sentiment. Additionally, this layer reduces the dimensions by eliminating those that are of zero value in terms of sentiment and thereby improves prediction accuracy. The third layer encompasses a dynamic model creation algorithm, termed Synchronous Targeted Feature Reduction (STFR). It is suitable for the challenge at hand whereby the mining of a stream of text is concerned. It updates the models with the most recent information available and, more importantly, it ensures that the dimensions are reduced to the absolute minimum. The algorithm and each of its layers are extensively evaluated using real market data and news content across multiple years and have proven to be solid and superior to any other comparable solution. The proposed techniques implemented in the system, result in significantly high directional-accuracies of up to 83.33%. On top of a well-rounded multifaceted algorithm, this work contributes a much needed research framework for this context with a test-bed of data that must make future research endeavors more convenient. The produced algorithm is scalable and its modular design allows improvement in each of its layers in future research. This paper provides ample details to reproduce the entire system and the conducted experiments. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. A.

As a starting point, we show improvements over the two state-ofthe-art approaches for single-speaker neural TTS: Deep Voice 1 and Tacotron. We introduce Deep Voice 2, which is based on a similar pipeline with Deep Voice 1, but constructed with higher performance building blocks and demonstrates a significant audio quality improvement over Deep Voice 1. We improve Tacotron by introducing a post-processing neural vocoder, and demonstrate a significant audio quality improvement. We then demonstrate our technique for multi-speaker speech synthesis for both Deep Voice 2 and Tacotron on two multi-speaker TTS datasets. We show that a single neural TTS system can learn hundreds of unique voices from less than half an hour of data per speaker, while achieving high audio quality synthesis and preserving the speaker identities almost perfectly.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Speech-driven 3 D Facial Animation with Implicit Emotional Awareness : A Deep Learning Approach\",\n          \"Text mining of news-headlines for FOREX market prediction: A Multi-layer Dimension Reduction Algorithm with semantics and sentiment\",\n          \"Deep Voice 2 : Multi-Speaker Neural Text-to-Speech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 196,\n        \"min\": 151,\n        \"max\": 621,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          171,\n          621,\n          151\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"_relevance_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.2986561357975006,\n          0.10069400072097778,\n          0.20968052744865417\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
