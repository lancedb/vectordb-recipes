## HyDE - Hypothetical Document Embeddings
This is advanced RAG  approach to dense retrieval that promises to make searching for information even more efficient and accurate


we provided Colab walkthrough for HyDE implementation   <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/Advance-RAG-with-HyDE/main.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></a>

The HyDE approach recognizes the difficulty of zero-shot learning and encoding relevance without labeled data. Instead, it leverages the power of language models and hypothetical documents. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Generating Hypothetical Documents**: When a user enters a query, HyDE instructs a language model, like GPT-3, to generate a hypothetical document. This document is designed to capture relevance patterns but may contain inaccuracies.
2. **Unsupervised Encoding**: The generated hypothetical document is then encoded into an embedding vector using an unsupervised contrastive encoder. This vector identifies a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space, where similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity.
3. **Retrieval Process**: HyDE searches for real documents in the corpus that are most similar to the encoded hypothetical document. The retrieved documents are then presented as search results.
