            "I was 21 when my fiance asked me to marry him. We were only engaged for 6 months before the inncident. My middle oldest sister, lets call her Nicky, was a very cold person. She only ever opened up to my fiance as she said she saw him as a brother. She and I never saw eye to eye, I loved her dearly because she was my sister but didn't like her as a person. The night was going smoothly until Nicky spotted a guy across the room whom she claimed she wanted to \"climb like a tree\" She walked over to him and within a few minutes she was back and she had a sour expression on her face. She then told me the guy didn't want her number but he wanted mine instead. I don't remember what happened next as I blacked out and the next morning I woke up on a hard sofa, my head pounding. When I came to, I realised I was in Nicky's friends house and my phone was sitting on the glass table in front of me, but it was flat. I tried to explain that my phone went flat but he then went on screaming about how could I cheat on him. Nicky told her ex fiance that she had slept with him multiple times. When he found out he left and never returned any of her calls or texts. Nicky's mother kicked her out and threw her things out. She was homeless and single in less than a day and a half. She tried everything to get her fiance back and her family back. But they all chose Nicky and her side and left her to fend for herself. She has not spoken to any of them in two years and doesn't know if she can ever forgive them. If you would like to talk to her about her story, please contact her on 020 3615 9090.
