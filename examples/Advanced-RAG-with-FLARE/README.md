## FLARE (Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation)

An application that demonstrates the FLARE technology, we used langchain for FLAIRchain & it 
enabling users to ask questions directly to academic papers, particularly focusing on ArXiv papers.

Getting Started for Flaire Chain Setup


### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
### 2. Install the package

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the command: 

```
python3 app.py
```

The Gradio app should now be running and accessible for interactions.

also we provided Colab walkthrough for HyDE   <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/blob/main/examples/Advanced-RAG-with-FLARE/main.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></a>
