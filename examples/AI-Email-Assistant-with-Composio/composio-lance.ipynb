    "This guide demonstrates how to integrate Composioâ€™s Gmail tool with LanceDB to create an agent that will automatically respond to emails by searching a LanceDB vectorstore for relevant information and using that information to draft replies. This setup is useful for automating email responses by leveraging a vector store that contains relevant data, such as FAQs or documentation. Composio allows an AI agent/your app to easily connect to your user's apps like Gmail, Slack, Trello etc. Paired together with LanceDB to store, manage and query data, more personalized and context-aware agents can be created."
