    "These days, there are tons of frameworks out there to help you whip up AI agents fast. Honestly, it feels like a new “low-code” tool shows up every other day, promising to make building agents a breeze. They’re all over the place—simple drag-and-drop setups or text boxes where you plug in a few prompts and some data, and just like that, your agent’s ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, we will go all in to create a fintech AI agent with no framework, everything is in raw python. This notebook carries an imporant appication of the fintech industry where people face enormus amount of time in processsing loan queries and insurance claims."

    "For the language model operations, I’ve implemented Mistral as the foundation, delivering reliable and efficient performance tailored to various tasks. However, the setup is highly flexible—you can seamlessly switch to any other provider or model that better suits your specific needs, ensuring adaptability for your unique use case. The same level of customization applies to the embedding model, allowing you to choose an alternative that aligns perfectly with your project requirements. If you decide to stick with this configuration, just remember to include your `Hugging Face token` and `Mistral API key` to authenticate and unlock the full potential of the system without any hiccups.\n"

I was alone in the car, and thankfully, I only have some minor bruises and a slight concussion, but my car is pretty badly damaged. The front end is smashed, and the airbags deployed, so I'm sure the repairs will be costly.\n",
