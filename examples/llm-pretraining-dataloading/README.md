# LLM Pre-training Data loading with Lance
![GPT](https://github.com/lancedb/vectordb-recipes/assets/15766192/11b3b900-0bcb-4a4a-8fd4-804611c85972)

In this example, we will Pre-train a GPT model from scratch on the TinyStories dataset. For the complex task of memory-efficient data loading, we will be using lance.

If you are running the scripts, it is important that you must first run the `data_prep.py` script (and only once) and then run the `train.py` script.

If you are following the Kaggle Walkthrough, you don't need to run any script in advance. Instead, just fork Kaggle notebook and run it.
