      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI found several exercise routines that can help improve running performance. Here are some steps you can follow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Warm up: Start with a 5-10 minute brisk walk or light jog to warm up your muscles and increase blood flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Squats: Squats are an effective exercise that targets every muscle in your legs. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, then drop your hips back and down as if you're sitting into a chair. Keep your chest up and your knees in line with your toes. Push through your heels to return to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Lunges: Lunges are great for strengthening your leg muscles and improving stability. Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart. Take a big step forward with your right foot and lower your body down until your right knee is at a 90-degree angle. Push through your right heel to return to the starting position. Repeat on the other side. Do 3 sets of 10-12 reps on each leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Plank: Planks are a fantastic exercise for core strength, which is important for maintaining good running form. Start in a push-up position, then lower down onto your forearms. Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe, engaging your core muscles. Hold this position for 30-60 seconds, then rest and repeat for 3 sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Push-ups: Push-ups are a compound exercise that works multiple muscle groups, including your chest, shoulders, and triceps. Start in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body down by bending your elbows, then push back up to the starting position. If regular push-ups are too challenging, you can modify by doing them on your knees. Aim for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Glute bridges: Glute bridges target your glutes and hamstrings, which are important for power and stability while running. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Lift your hips up towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top. Lower back down and repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to listen to your body and start with weights and intensities that are appropriate for your fitness level. It's also important to incorporate rest days into your routine to allow your muscles to recover. Stay hydrated and fuel your body with nutritious foods to support your training.\n",
