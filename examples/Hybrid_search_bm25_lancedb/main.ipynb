    "# **Hybrid Search**\n",
    "**BM25** is a sophisticated ranking function used in information retrieval. Acting like a highly efficient librarian, it excels in navigating through extensive collections of documents. Its effectiveness lies in term Frequency: Evaluating how often search terms appear in each document. Document Length Normalization: Ensuring a fair chance for both short and long documents in search results. Bias-Free Information Retrieval: Ideal for large data sets where unbiased results are critical. About LanceDB (VectorDB) LanceDB extends our search capabilities beyond mere keyword matching. It brings in a layer of contextual understanding, interpreting the semantics of search queries to provide results that align with the intended meaning\n",

Vitamin D: Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and is crucial for bone health. Food sources of vitamin D include fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, egg yolks, and fortified foods like milk and orange juice. The body can also produce vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight.\\n\\n3. Phosphorus: Phosphorus works together with calcium to build strong bones and teeth. Good sources of phosphorus include dairy products, meat, fish, poultry, whole grains, and nuts.\\n\\n4. Vitamin K: Vitamin K plays a role in bone metabolism and helps with the formation of osteocalcin, a protein that is necessary for bone strength. Good sources of vitamin K include leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.\\n\\n5. Magnesium: Magnesium is involved in the formation of bone crystals and helps regulate calcium levels in the body. Food sources of magnesium include nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, and leafy green vegetables.\\n\\nIt's important to note that a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods is essential for overall bone health.
