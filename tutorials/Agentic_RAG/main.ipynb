        "Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced framework designed to handle complex information retrieval tasks using a network of intelligent agents. These agents collaborate to perform nuanced tasks such as synthesizing information from multiple documents, summarizing content, and comparing data points across various sources. Agentic RAG infuses autonomy and intelligence into traditional retrieval systems, enabling them to act as passive tools and proactive entities that understand context, evaluate data quality, and make informed decisions."
